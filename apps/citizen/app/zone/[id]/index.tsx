 *
 *  - the **zone** itself — name, hours, capacity, live availability — which the
 *    map already fetched from the one public endpoint;
 *  - the **bay records**, which are what split "not free" into occupied and
 *    booked, and what say which kind of bay is free;
 *  - the **rate card**, which is what the fare rows are.
 *
 * The last two are guarded by permissions a citizen account does not hold, so
 * today they answer 403 and their sections say so by name. That is deliberate:
 * a driver told "we cannot show you the price" will ask somebody; a driver
 * shown ₹0 will park and then argue with an attendant.
