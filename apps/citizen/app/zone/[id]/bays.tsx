/**
 * Every bay in one car park, as a grid.
 *
 * A grid rather than a plan, because a plan would be a fiction. The `Slot`
 * model holds an id, a zone, a code, a type and a status — no floor, no level,
 * no coordinates — so there is nothing to lay anything out against. Sorting by
 * code and filling left to right puts A01 next to A02, which is the only
 * spatial fact that actually exists, and the codes are the ones painted on the
 * ground so a driver can match what they see.
 *
 * This is not a booking screen. Nothing here is reservable in this release; it
 * tells somebody where the space is before they turn in off the road, which is
 * most of the value and none of the operational risk.
